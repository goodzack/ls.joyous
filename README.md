# About

Joyous is a reusable calendar application for Wagtail. Features include
rrule based recurring events with cancellations and postponements; iCal
import and export; Gcal export; RSS feed; event permissioning; timezone
handling; and multi-site aware calendars.

**This is a fork that has some small changes to be compatible with Wagtail 6 and has not been tested at all. Many of the written tests now fail! Caveat emptor!**
